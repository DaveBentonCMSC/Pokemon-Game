 Pokemon Game for CMSC 202

This is a game written for my CMSC 202 class. Involves the use of linked lists to create a functional text-based game similar to Pokemon Stadium.
It is designed to run on a Linux system. Run make, then ./proj3 proj3_data.txt. Can be run with other properly formatted text files if desired.
